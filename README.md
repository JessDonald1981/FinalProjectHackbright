Documentation Notes 
Create document with rape crisis center information 
-name of center
-zipcode/city of center
-phone number 
-hotline
-website


Use map database to find latitude and longitude of each center 
Create script that will bring up crisis center when city entered 
Add national RAINN. Net national hotline to bottom of every screen 




UI 
Ask user for name of city 
Ask user if done 
If done/print then show user rape crisis center 






Questions 
How can I use the national database set up by RAINN to mine the info for the rest of the country? 




Do I need to add the address to the Google doc? Or will it be okay to be brought up through a link? 


Gathering requirements, 
good communication, 
documentation, 
pseudocoding, and 
design are important parts of what you do.
